A LETTER FROM LOCH
 
On September 27 the first Memfest, in honor of the late Memorie King, was held at Beans 'n Berries Farm in Bottleneck NC. The music by Underhill Rose, Utah Green, and South Mountain SLT was splendid. Unfortunately the weather was rotten. No one could visually experience the precession of the moon or the eclipse but the cosmic effect was still relevant. So we turned it into a house concert and the acoustics were great! Also the weather held down attendance to mostly the hard core of lovers of Memorie but that did not detract from the pleasure that we all felt. Especially exciting was a rewritten version of "Sugar Mama" by UR especially in Memorie's honor. Her love and generosity made her everybody's "sugar mama" and putting the song into a positive key lyrically made it if not better certainly more appropriate. People did come from Asheville and Virginia for this celebration of a life well, if too briefly lived. Lots of Bridges bar-b-que and red wine was consumed and some people brought treats mostly notably the Richie's. Also Terry Pagano, Sai and Martie deserve praise for giving up their time and putting a lot of effort  into making this happen.
 
We did not get to use the outside stage that was the subject of so much planning and effort. However on Dec 20 we will have a bonfire and are taking suggestions for other appropriate ways to remember Mem. She did not want to be forgotten and deserves remembrance.
